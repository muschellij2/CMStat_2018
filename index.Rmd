## UK Biobank Data

<div style="font-size:30pt">

- Overall 500,000 participants (UK), ≈ 100,000 included in the sub-study

In this presentation: 

- Explore the data 
- Assess "bias" in different devices (see if "autocalibration" is working)
- Also discuss inclusion criteria "bias"
- Get similar findings [@doherty2017large] analysis

# Lesson #1: The devil is in the inclusion criteria<br>(or can be)

## Data Gathered

- Tri-axial Axtivity 100Hz over **7 days**
- Started at 10AM and ended at 10PM (spoiler: will be important)
- Data measured in milli-g (1$g$ = 9.80665 $\frac{m}{s^2}$)
  - not counts or steps as other devices

```{r, out.width="28%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/triax.jpg")
```

## Accelerometry Data Available

<div style="font-size:20pt" id="left_col">

- Data at varyling levels
  - Axtivity CWA format (Highest resolution, 100Hz) (200Mb per user)
    - very large for 100K subjects (20Tb)
- 5 second level data 
  - UKBB imputation/processing done
  - averaged into 1440 minute-level data
- Overall statistics (mean/median): overall, daily, hourly, day of week
  - removed "non-wear" periods

## UKBB Processing: Auto-calibration 
<div id = "left_col2">
[@van2014autocalibration]

1. Use 10$s$ window all axes SD $< 13.0$ m$g$.
2. Fit a unit gravity sphere using OLS.
3. If 3 axes had values outside a $\pm 300$m$g$ range - use calibration coefficient
4. If not, use **next person's** calibration coefficient from the same device

</div>

## Auto-calibration seems to "work"

- Within-person average, within-device average (one point per device)
- Plotted against # of wears per device ($σ$ should decrease with $\sqrt{n}$)

<!-- Show some of the things about device specific measures -->
<!-- - no large signs of bias -->
<!-- - plan on doing matching -->

# Lesson #2: If magnitude is important, need calibration <br>("batch effect" correction),<br> but may not be perfect

## UKBB Processing: @doherty2017large


- Recording errors and 'interrupts' flagged (plug in accelerometer to computer)
- $\pm8g$ flagged
- Resampled to 100 Hz (interrupts > 5 seconds set to missing)
- Euclidean norm, fourth order Butterworth low pass filter (f = 20Hz). 
- Subtract $1g$, negative values set to $0$

## How do people typically move? 

- Average over minute - regardless of mulitple visits per person

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/overall_plot.png")
```

## How do people typically move? 

- Average over minute with days > 95% non-missing data

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/overall_plot_good.png")
```

# (Maybe) Lesson #3: Keep only "full" days

## Not so fast, let's look day by day

- Average over minute for days separately, one row per subject

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/daily_plot.png")
```

## Removing Day 7

- Average over minute for days 0 - 6

```{r, out.width="90%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/Mean_overall_noday7_plot.png")
```

# Lesson #3: Explore days before averaging across in individual?

## Well use the MEDIAN then!

## Takehome Messages

<div style="font-size:30pt">

1. Start off smaller than 100K people
2. Inspect the raw(ish) data
3. Processing highly affects results
    - Autocalibration seems to work well on gross features (with 100K people)
    - Artifacts still seem present in the data
4. Inclusion criteria matters (esp. for inference)
5. **Back to the 100Hz data** we go!

</div>

## Next data installment 

"We invited some participants to wear an activity monitor for a week, four times a year. ... finished in early 2019."

## References (and Thanks)



<!-- ## We're ready for analysis right? -->

<!-- - Nope!  Need to estimate "wear time" -->

<!-- ```{r, out.width="80%", fig.align="center"} -->
<!-- knitr::include_graphics("images/it-never-ends.jpg") -->
<!-- ``` -->


<!-- ## Wear time -->

<!-- "We removed non-wear time, defined as consecutive stationary episodes lasting for at least 60 minutes where all three axes had a standard deviation of less than 13.0 m$g$" -->

<!-- @doherty2017large -->


<!-- ## Why 13m$g$? -->

<!-- "Here, 13 m$g$ was selected just above the empirically derived baseline (noise) standard deviation of 10 m$g$ to retain only nonmovement periods." @van2014autocalibration -->
